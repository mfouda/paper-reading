## Papers

### Deterministic Approaches

* **`DIRECT`** [Lipschitzian Optimization without the Lipschitz Constant](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00941892), D. Jones et al., 1993.

### Stochastic Approaches

* [Maximizing Acquisition Functions for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10196), J. Wilson et al., 2018.
	- In this paper, the authors investigated two approaches for addressing BO's inner optimization problem, namely the differentiability of Monte Carlo integration and the submodularity of parallel querying.
